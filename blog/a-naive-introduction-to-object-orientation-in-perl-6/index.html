<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This tutorial will at most concern itself with the basic of object oriented
programming (OOP) in Perl 6. As result, it&rsquo;s important that you have a basic
understanding of statements/expressions, variables, conditionals, loops,
subroutines (functions), etc., which if not in Perl 6, at least in another
programming language. In addition, you should at least have a general understanding
of classes, attributes, and methods. As an introduction to Perl 6, I highly
recommend <a href="https://perl6intro.com">Perl 6 Introduction</a>. The next step would
be the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/">Perl 6 Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure you have set up the Perl 6 compiler. <a href="https://perl6.org/getting-started/">Look
here</a> on how to get started if you haven&rsquo;t
done it yet.</p>
<p>From here onward, you might get tired of the pronoun &lsquo;we&rsquo; but its use is
deliberate. This is a tutorial and you&rsquo;re expected to follow along. So yes,
&ldquo;we&rdquo; are working together in this and you should get ready. By the way, the
tutorial is in the lengthy side, which is intended but also a by-product of
an explained step-by-step tutorial.</p>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ll begin with what might be considered a real life problem and try to model
it in an object oriented fashion. The problem statement is laid out as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In her MATH-101 class, a professor has recorded the following marks for three
assignments (2 homeworks and 1 exam) in the order they were turned in by
her students:</p>
<pre><code>    Bill Jones:1:35
    Sara Tims:2:45
    Sara Tims:1:39
    Bill Jones:1:42
    Bill Jones:E1:72
</code></pre>
<p>in a simple text file named <em>MATH-101</em>. You can assume that there are more
students and this is just a representative chunk of the data file. In this
file, each row records the student&rsquo;s name, the assignment number (1,
2 for homeworks or E1 for the first exam), and the raw score the student obtained.</p>
<p>The professor uses another file with extension <code>.std</code> to store a list of
the students enrolled in her course:</p>
<pre><code>    Bill Jones
    Ana Smith
    Sara Tims
    Frank Horza
</code></pre>
<p>Besides <em>MATH-101</em>, the professor teaches other courses and has devised a
configuration file with the extension <code>.cfg</code> to store the configuration
format for a given course. She has done it with the intention of using
it for her other courses as well.
The configuration file format specifies the type of assignment, the
assignment number, the total score possible for the assignment and the
assignment&rsquo;s contribution to the final course grade. The <code>.cfg</code> file for her
<em>MATH-101</em> class looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    Homework:1:50:25
    Homework:2:50:25
    Exam:1:75:50
</code></pre>
<p>You&rsquo;re tasked with creating a program named <code>report.p6</code> that generates a report that lists the
name, the scores on each assignment, and the final grade for each student in
the class. The program should assume that the files with extensions
<code>.cgf</code> and <code>.std</code> are available in the directory where such program is executed.
On the other hand, the file containing the student grades must be passed to
the program in the command line. For simplicity&rsquo;s sake you can assume each
file is named after the course. For her MATH-101 class, the professor would
have the following files: <code>MATH-101</code>, <code>MATH-101.std</code> and <code>MATH-101.cfg</code>
along with the script <code>report.p6</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>If we look at the problem statement, we can group everything into three
categories: courses, students and assignments. As it stands, each category can
be treated as a class with state and behavior. We&rsquo;ll build from the most simple
category, the assignment category, to the most general one, the course category.
To do that, let&rsquo;s first learn about class definition in Perl 6.</p>
<h2 id="a-perl-6-class">A Perl 6 class</h2>
<h3 id="class-definition">Class definition</h3>
<p>In Perl 6, a class is defined with the <code>class</code> keyword, typically followed
by its name (usually in titlecase).</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Name-of-class {

}
</code></pre><h3 id="attribute-definition">Attribute definition</h3>
<p>All Perl 6 attributes are private by default which means they can only be
accessed within the class. An attribute is defined using the <code>has</code> keyword
and the <code>!</code> twigil.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Name-of-class {
    has $!attribute-name;
}
</code></pre><p>An attribute can also be defined using the <code>.</code> twigil. This twigil states
that a read-only accessor method, named after the attribute, should be
generated:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Name-of-class {
    has $.attribute-name; # $!attribute-name + attribute-name()
}
</code></pre><p>This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Name-of-class {
    has $!attribute-name;
    
    method attribute-name { 
        return $!attribute-name;
    }
}
</code></pre><p>The generated accessor method is read-only because attributes are read-only
(from outside the class) by default. To allow the modification of the attribute
through its accessor method, the trait <code>is rw</code> must be added to the
attribute. Other traits can be used on attributes as well. Check the
<a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/typesystem">documentation</a> for
more information about traits.</p>
<h2 id="the-assignment-class">The Assignment class</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by detailing the attributes needed for the <code>Assignment</code> class:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>type</code> - the assignment&rsquo;s type (Homework or Exam).</li>
<li><code>number</code> - the assignment&rsquo;s number (1, 2, etc.).</li>
<li><code>score</code> - the score received for that assignment.</li>
<li><code>raw</code> - the maximum number of points for a given assignment.</li>
<li><code>contrib</code> - the amount of points the assignment contributes towards the final grade.</li>
<li><code>adjusted-score</code> - formatted score based on the <code>score</code>, <code>raw</code> and <code>contrib</code>
attributes.</li>
<li><code>config</code> - a hash which contains the configuration file for the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the <code>config</code> hash, the information for each assignment will be
stored in a array and this array will be indexed by the assignment number in
the array for the respective assignment (either Homework or Exam). Given that
there&rsquo;s no zeroth assignment, this slot will be used to store the total of
assignments processed. The <code>config</code> hash for <em>MATH-101.cfg</em> would look like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>%(
    Homework =&gt; [ {total =&gt; 2}, (50, 25), (50, 25) ],
    Exam =&gt; [ {total =&gt; 1}, (75, 50) ],
)
</code></pre><p>This results in the following class:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Assignment {
    # attributes with a read-only accessor
    has $.type;
    has $.number;
    has $.score;
    has %.config;   # given that a hash is used, the $ (scalar) is replaced
                    # with a % (hash).

    # private attributes hence the ! twigil.
    has $!raw;
    has $!contrib;
    has $!adjusted-score;
}
</code></pre><p>To create an instance of the <code>Assignment</code> class and initialize it, we pass named
parameters to the default <code>new</code> constructor method provided by Perl 6
and inherited by all the classes:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># create a new instance object and initialize its attributes. 
# The new constructor is called on Assignment, the type object of 
# the class Assignment.
my $assign01 = Assignment.new(
    type =&gt; &#39;Homework&#39;, # named argument 
    :number(2),         # Alternate colon-pair syntax for named arguments
    :score(45),
    :config(%(
        Homework =&gt; [ {total =&gt; 2}, (50, 25), (50, 25) ],
        Exam =&gt; [ {total =&gt; 1}, (75, 50) ])
    ),
 );

# accessing the instance object&#39;s attributes 
# through their accessor method:
say $assign01.type();     # OUTPUT: &#39;Homework&#39;
say $assign01.number();   # OUTPUT: 2
say $assign01.score();    # OUTPUT: 45
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If an attribute is defined with the <code>!</code> twigil, then the <code>new</code>
constructor method cannot be used to initialize it. As it was mentioned
before, this is due to the attribute being private which means it cannot be
accessed from outside the class, not even with the <code>new</code> constructor. However,
this default behavior can be overriden with the <code>BUILD</code> submethod.
Check the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/objects#Object_Construction">documentation</a> for
more info about the <code>BUILD</code> submethod.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We already know that the type of the assignment will always be a string, the
number a whole number, the adjusted score a rational, etc. so we might as
well type the attributes accordingly:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Assignment {
    has Str $.type;
    has Int $.number;
    has $.score;
    has %.config;

    has $!raw;
    has $!contrib;
    has Rat $!adjusted-score;
}
</code></pre><p>Check the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/typesystem">documentation</a> for more
information about types.</p>
<p>The behavior of the <code>Assignment</code> class will largely depend on the data from each
student but we know nothing about the structure of the <code>Student</code> class yet. For
this reason, we&rsquo;ll move on to the <code>Student</code> class and come back to this later.</p>
<h2 id="the-student-class">The Student class</h2>
<p>Similar to the <code>Assignment</code> class, let&rsquo;s begin by detailing the attributes
the <code>Student</code> class will have:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>name</code> - a string representing the student&rsquo;s name.</li>
<li><code>assign-num</code> - the number of assignments (a whole number).</li>
<li><code>assignments</code> - we wish to divide the assignments into their types (Homework
or Exam) so we&rsquo;ll use a hash. Each key will point to an array of
their respective <code>Assignments</code> objects.</li>
<li><code>config</code> - the configuration file for the course which was described in
the <code>Assignment</code> class.</li>
</ul>
<p>This results in the following class:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Student {
    has Str $.name;
    has Int $!assign-num = 0;
    has %!assignments;
    has %.config;
}
</code></pre><p>We should be able to <code>add-assignments</code> to an instance of the <code>Student</code> class and
<code>get-homeworks</code>, <code>get-exams</code>, etc. from it as well. These sort of actions
represent the behavior of the class and are achieved through the use of methods.</p>
<h3 id="public-and-private-methods">Public and private methods</h3>
<p>As stated in the <a href="https://perl6intro.com/#_methods">Perl 6 Introduction</a>, &ldquo;methods
are the subroutines of an object and just like subroutines, they are a means
of packaging a set of functionality, they accept arguments, have a signature
and can be defined as multi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Perl 6 method is defined using the <code>method</code> keyword and it&rsquo;s invoked on
the invocant using a dot (<code>.</code>). By default, all methods are public. However,
methods can be defined as private by prepending their names with an exclamation
mark (<code>!</code>). In this case, instead of a dot, an exclamation mark is used to
invoke them.</p>
<p>With this knowledge, we&rsquo;ll now add an <code>add-assignment</code> method to the <code>Student</code>
class. This method will need the number of the assignment (1, 2, 3, etc. or E1,
E2, etc.) and the score received. The type of assignment will not be provided
but we can determine it using its number:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Student {
    # same attributes as before.

    method add-assignment( $number is copy, $score ) {
        my $type;
       
        # determine the assignment type.
        if $number ~~ s/^E// {   # do replacement in place
            $type = &#39;Exam&#39;;      # to obtain the exam&#39;s number.
        }
        else {
            $type = &#39;Homework&#39;;
        }
    
        # coerce assignment number to an integer.
        $number .= Int;
        
        # create an Assignment object from available information.
        my $assign-obj = Assignment.new(
            type   =&gt; $type,
            number =&gt; $number,
            score  =&gt; $score,
            config =&gt; %!config,
        );
    
        # add assignment into its type indexed by its number.
        %!assignments{$type}[$number] = $assign-obj;
    
        # increment number of assignments by 1.
        $!assign-num++; 
    
    }
    
}
</code></pre><p>To showcase the creation of a private method, we&rsquo;ll outsource the creation
of the <code>Assignment</code> object inside the <code>add-assignment</code> method to a private
method called <code>create-assignment</code> which returns an <code>Assignment</code> object:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Student {
    # same as before
    
    # notice the ! twigil before the method&#39;s name.
    method !create-assignment( Str $type, Int $number, $score ) { 
        return Assignment.new(
            type   =&gt; $type,
            number =&gt; $number,
            score  =&gt; $score,
            config =&gt; %!config,
        );
    }

    method add-assignment( $number is copy, $score ) {
        # same code as before.
  		        
        # create an Assignment object with this information.
        my $assign-obj = self!create-assignment($type, $number, $score);
        
        # same code as before.
    }
       
} 
</code></pre><p>As you may have noticed, the <code>self</code> keyword was used to invoke the
<code>create-assignment</code> method inside the <code>add-assignment</code> method. <code>self</code> is a
special variable bound to the invocant and available inside a method. This
variable can be used to call further methods on the invocant. Its invocation
inside methods is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>self!method($arg)</code> for private methods.</li>
<li><code>self.method($arg)</code> for public methods. <code>$.method($arg)</code> is its shortcut
form. Be aware that the colon-syntax for method arguments (positional and
named) is only supported for method calls when using <code>self</code>, not the shortcut
form. So:
<ul>
<li><code>self.method: arg1, arg2...</code> is supported.</li>
<li><code>$.method: arg1, arg2...</code> is not supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A method&rsquo;s signature always passes <code>self</code> as its first parameter. However,
we can specify an explicit invocant for the method by providing a first
parameter followed by a colon. This parameter will serve as the invocant for
the method and allow the method to refer to the object it was called on
explicitly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s come back to the <code>Assignment</code> class. As it stands, the consumer of the
class can pass whatever they want while creating an <code>Assignment</code> object. For
this reason, we might want to check if the assignment type and assignment number
are known. Another thing we might want to do is to modify the <code>raw</code> and
<code>contrib</code> attributes whose values depend on the data from the configuration
file. And the same applies to the <code>adjusted-score</code> attribute whose value depends
on the <code>raw</code>, <code>contrib</code> and <code>score</code> attributes.</p>
<p>Perl 6 provides an easy way to check things or modify attributes after object
construction through the <code>TWEAK</code> submethod. Simply put, a submethod is a
method that is not inherited by child classes. Check the
<a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/objects#Object_construction">documentation</a>
for more information about the <code>TWEAK</code> submethod.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s add the <code>TWEAK</code> submethod to the <code>Assignment</code> class:</p>

        unless $!type eq &#39;Homework&#39; | &#39;Exam&#39; {
            die &#34;unknown assignment type: $!type&#34;;

        }

        # update raw and contrib value from configuration data.
        ($!raw, $!contrib) = %!config{$!type}[$!number];

        # calculate the value of the adjusted score (rounded to two 
        # decimal places).
        $!adjusted-score = sprintf &#34;%.2f&#34;, $!score / ($!raw/$!contrib);

        # update type with assignment number. This will be useful 
        # when printing the report for a specific assignment.
        $!type = $!type eq &#39;Homework&#39;

</code></pre><h3 id="custom-constructors">Custom constructors</h3>
<p>Instead of using the <code>new</code> constructor to create an object from a specific
class, we would like to use a constructor method that reflects
what&rsquo;s being created. For example, a <code>create-course</code> constructor for the
<code>Course</code> class. We also would like to use positional parameters instead of
named parameters as in the <code>new</code> constructor. Creating a constructor
in Perl 6 is fairly easy; just create a method and return the <em>blessed</em>
parameters:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Course {
    # same code as before

    method create-course( $course ) {
        return self.bless(
            course =&gt; $course,
        );
    }

    # same code as before
}

# In addition to:
my $class01 = Course.new( course =&gt; &#39;GEO-102&#39; );

# We can also create a Course instance like this now:
my $class02 = Course.create-course( &#39;Math-101&#39; );
</code></pre><p>We didn&rsquo;t just write <code>return self.bless($course)</code> because the <code>bless</code> method
expects a set of named parameters to provide the initial values for each
attribute. As it was mentioned before, private attributes really
are private so this wouldn&rsquo;t have been enough for an attribute defined with
the <code>!</code> twigil. To do this, the <code>BUILD</code> submethod must be used, which
is called on the brand new object by the <code>bless</code> method. See
<a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/objects#Submethods">Submethods</a> and
<a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/classtut#Constructors">Constructors</a> for more
info about the <code>BUILD</code> submethod.</p>
<h3 id="instance-and-class-attributes">Instance and class attributes</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already discussed instance attributes, we just didn&rsquo;t identify them as
instance attributes. An <strong>instance attribute</strong> is an attribute owned by a
specific instance of a class, which means that two different object instances
of the same class are different. For example, the instances <code>$class01</code> and
<code>$class02</code> from the previous sections both have the same instance attributes
(<code>course</code>, <code>number</code>, etc.) but distinct values. In Perl 6, any attribute
declared with the <code>has</code> keyword is an instance attribute.</p>
<p>In the other hand, a <strong>class attribute</strong> is an attribute that belongs to the class
itself and not to its objects. Unlike an instance attribute, a class attribute
is shared by all the instances of the class.</p>
<p>In Perl 6, class attributes are declared using either the keyword <code>my</code> or <code>our</code>
(instead of <code>has</code>), depending on the scope (for example, <code>my $class-var;</code>).
Similar to instance attributes, declaring a class attribute with the <code>.</code>
twigil generates an accessor method (for example, <code>my $.class-var;</code>). Check
the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/classtut#Static_fields?">documentation</a> for
more info about class attributes.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t seen a class attribute yet but we&rsquo;ll create one now. For example,
we&rsquo;d like to know the number of courses we instantiate. To do this we can create
a class attribute in the <code>Course</code> class that keeps track of the number of
<code>Course</code> objects instantiated.</p>
<p>This class attribute must be updated whenever a new object is created so we must
modify both the default <code>new</code> and <code>create-course</code> constructors:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Course { 
    # other attributes.
    
    my Int $.course-count = 0; # class attribute with read-only accessor

    method create-course( $course ) {
        $.course-count++;      # updating the class attribute.
        return self.bless(
            course =&gt; $course,
        );
    }

    # we still want to pass named parameters to the new 
    # hence the &#39;:&#39; before the parameter.
    method new( :$course ) {
        $.course-count++;
        return self.bless(
            course =&gt; $course,
        );
    }

    # same code as before
}

for 1..5 {
    Course.create-course(&#39;PHYS-110&#39;);
    Course.new(course =&gt; &#39;BIO-112&#39;);
}

# accessing the class attribute&#39;s value by calling 
# its accessor method on the class itself.
say Course.course-count();  # OUTPUT: 10
</code></pre><h3 id="instance-and-class-methods">Instance and class methods</h3>
<p>An <strong>instance method</strong> requires an object instance over which to be called on.
It&rsquo;s usually expressed in the form <code>$object.instance-method()</code>. For example,
<code>print-report()</code> is an instance method of the <code>Course</code> class and requires an
instance of that class to be called on (e.g., <code>$class.print-report()</code>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, a <strong>class method</strong> belongs to the class as a whole and as
result it doesn&rsquo;t require an instance of the class. It&rsquo;s usually expressed
in the form <code>class.class-method()</code>. For example, the <code>new</code> constructor is a
class method that is called directly on the class, not an instance of it.</p>
<p>Earlier we noted that an explicit invocant can be passed to a method. Besides
referring to the object explicitly, an invocant provided in the method&rsquo;s
signature also allows to define the method as either as an instance method, or
as a class method, through the use of type constraints. The special variable
<code>::?CLASS</code> can be used to provide the class name at compile time, combined
with either <code>:U</code> (as in <code>::?CLASS:U</code>) for class methods or <code>:D</code> (as in
<code>::?CLASS:D</code>) for instance methods. By the way, the <code>:U</code> and <code>:D</code> are referred
to as <em>smileys</em> in Perl 6 lingo.</p>
<p>The <code>create-course</code> method is intended to be used solely as a class method,
however, as of now, nothing prevents its use on an instance.
To avoid this, we can use the special variable <code>?::CLASS</code> with the <code>:U</code>
type modifier on the invocant which will cause the method to actively refuse
invocations on instances, and only permit invocation through the type object.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Course {
    # other attributes

<p>You probably noticed that after creating the <code>Course</code> instance we had to invoke

</code></pre><p>The problem statement states that the program should receive the student grades
through the command line. Perl 6 makes command line arguments parsing quite
easy and we just need to define a <code>MAIN</code> subroutine to take a positional
argument, namely the file named after the course that contains the student
grades. To learn more about the <code>MAIN</code> subroutine,

<h2 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already finished with the task proposed by the problem statement but
the topic we&rsquo;ll discuss here is quite important in the OOP paradigm. The
<code>Student</code> class has an attribute that stores the courses a student has been
enrolled in. Now, let&rsquo;s suppose we want to create a class <code>PTStudent</code> class
for part-time students that limits the number of courses a student can be
enrolled in. Given that a part-time student is certainly a student, we might
be enticed to duplicate the code from the <code>Student</code> class into the <code>PTStudent</code>
and then add the necessary restrictions. Although technically fine, the
duplication of code is considered a suboptimal, error prone and conceptually
flawed endeavor. Instead of this, we can make of use of a mechanism known as
<strong>inheritance</strong>.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, inheritance allows to derive a new class (with modifications)
from an existing class. This means you do not have to create entire new classes
that duplicate parts of existing classes. In this process, the inherited classes
are the <strong>child</strong> classes (or subclasses) of the <strong>parent</strong> class.</p>
<p>In Perl 6, the <code>is</code> keyword defines inheritance.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Assume Student is defined here.

class PTStudent is Student {
    # new attributes particular to PTStudent.
    has @.courses;
    my $.course-limit = 3;  
    
    # new method too.
    method add-course( $course ) {
        @.courses == $.course-limit {
            die &#34;Number of courses exceeds limit of $.course-limit.&#34;;
        }
        
        push @.courses, $course;
    }
}

my $student2 = PTStudent.new(
    name =&gt; &#34;Tim Polaz&#34;,
    config =&gt; %(),
);

$student2.add-course( &#39;BIO-101&#39; );
$student2.add-course( &#39;GEO-101&#39; );
$student2.add-course( &#39;PHY-102&#39; );

$student2.courses.join(&#39; &#39;);       # OUTPUT: &#39;BIO-101 GEO-101 PHY-102&#39;
        
$student2.add-course( &#39;ENG-220&#39; ); # (error) OUTPUT: Number of courses exceeds 
                                   # limit of 3.
</code></pre><p>The <code>PTStudent</code> class has inherited the attributes and methods of its parent
class <code>Student</code>. On top of that, we&rsquo;ve added two new attributes and a new
method to it as well.</p>
<p>If we wanted we could have redefined the methods inherited from the <code>Student</code>
class. This concept is known as <strong>overriding</strong> and it allows to provide a
per class implementation of methods common to parent and child classes.</p>
<p>In addition to single inheritance, multiple inheritance (inheriting from
multiple classes at one time) is also possible in Perl 6. Check the
<a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/classtut#Multiple_inheritance">documentation</a>
for more information about it.</p>
<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
<p>Similar to classes, roles carry state and behavior with them. However, unlike
classes, roles are meant to describe specific components of an object&rsquo;s
behavior. In Perl 6, a role is defined with the <code>role</code> keyword and applied to
a class or an object with the <code>does</code> trait (as opposed to <code>is</code> for inheritance).</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Assume Student is defined here

role course-limitation {
	has @.courses;
    my Int $.course-limit = 3;
   
    method add-course( $course ) {
        if @.courses == $.course-limit {
            die &#34;Number of courses exceeds limit of $.course-limit.&#34;;
        }
        @.courses.push($course);
    }
}

# inheriting from the Student class and applying role.
class PTStudent is Student does course-limitation { }

my $student2 = PTStudent.new(
    name =&gt; &#34;Tim Polaz&#34;,
    config =&gt; %()
);

$student2.add-course( &#39;MATH-101&#39; );
$student2.add-course( &#39;GEO-101&#39; );
$student2.add-course( &#39;PHY-102&#39; );

say $student2.courses.join(&#39; &#39;);   # OUTPUT: &#39;MATH-101 GEO-101 PHY-102&#39;
        
$student2.add-course( &#39;ENG-220&#39; ); # (error) OUTPUT: Number of courses exceeds 
                                   # limit of 3.
</code></pre><p>We&rsquo;ve demonstrated how roles work but this doesn&rsquo;t show a complete picture of
them. For example, just like multiple inheritance, roles can be implemented
multiple times in a class (e.g., <code>class Name does role1 does role2 does ...</code>).
However, unlike with multiple inheritance, should a conflict arise from the
application of multiple roles, a compile-time error will be thrown. With multiple
inheritance, the conflict wouldn&rsquo;t be considered an error and would be
resolved at runtime.</p>
<p>In short, roles can be thought of an alternative to inheritance; instead of
extending a class hierarchy through subclassing, a programmer composes a
class using roles that provide <em>supplementary behaviors</em> for what the class
does.</p>
<h2 id="introspection">Introspection</h2>
<p><strong>Introspection</strong> is the process by which an object can gather information
such as type, methods, attributes, etc. about itself and other objects.</p>
<p>In Perl 6, introspection is facilitated by the following constructs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.WHAT</code> - returns the type object associated with the object.</li>
<li><code>.perl</code> - returns a string that can be executed as Perl 6 code.</li>
<li><code>.^name</code> - returns the class name.</li>
<li><code>.^attributes</code> - returns all the attributes of the object.</li>
<li><code>.^methods</code> - returns all the methods that can be called on the object.</li>
<li><code>.^parents</code> - returns the parent classes of the object.</li>
<li><code>~~</code> is the smartmatch operator. It evaluates to <code>True</code> if the object
is created from the class it is being compared against or any of its
inheritances.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>.^</code> syntax is the meta-method call. The use of this syntax instead of a
single dot means a method call on its <em>meta</em> class, which is class that manages
the properties of all the classes. In fact, <code>obj.^meth</code> translates to
<code>obj.HOW.meth(obj)</code> where <code>meth</code> is a certain method.</p>
<p>Using the object <code>$student2</code> from the previous section:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>say $student2.WHAT;         # OUTPUT: (PTStudent)
say $student2.perl;         # OUTPUT: PTStudent.new(name =&gt; &#34;Tim Polaz&#34;, 
                            #         config =&gt; {}, courses =&gt; [])
say $student2.^name;        # OUTPUT: PTStudent
say $student2.^attributes;  # OUTPUT: (Str $!name Associative %!config Mu 
                            #          $!assig-num Associative %!assignments
                            #          Positional @!courses)
say $student2.^methods;     # OUTPUT: (course-limit add-course name 
                            #          add-assignment courses config get-exams
                            #          print-report get-homeworks BUILDALL)
say $student2.^parents;     # OUTPUT: ((Student))

say $student2 ~~ PTStudent; # True
say $student2 ~~ Student;   # True
say $student2 ~~ Str;       # False
</code></pre><p>As you can see, there&rsquo;s a lot you can learn from an instance of class
through introspection.</p>
<p>Introspection is not limited to programmer-defined classes. Introspection is
at the core of Perl 6 and is a very useful tool to find out about built-in
types and learn more about the language as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, we learned about defining classes, private and public attributes,
and private and public methods. We also learned how to create custom
constructors and restrict their invocation to either classes or instances of
classes. Furthermore, we briefly discussed how to facilitate code reuse through
inheritance and roles in Perl 6. Finally, we touched on the process of
introspection and how, in its most simple form, is useful to learn about
objects.</p>
<p>Regarding the program <code>report.p6</code>, we limited ourselves to the problem statement
but the user of the program could benefit from extra functionalities. For
example, the program could be modified to provide an interactive query for
individual students to allow student lookup from the command line. In addition,
the program could read multiple courses and then query them all to retrieve
and print a record for a particular student.</p>
<p>Right below I&rsquo;ve linked to both the program we created here and the one implementing
the extra functionalities mentioned previously. Hopefully this whole tutorial
was informative and helpful.</p>

function to color the course names to better tell them apart from the
remaining text. With some course files, this is how the output ends up looking:</p>
